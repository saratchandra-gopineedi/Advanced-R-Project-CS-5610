I.  **MOTIVATION AND OVERVIEW**

The objective is to create a Shiny application that provides
personalized grant recommendations to users based on their preferences
and historical ratings. The primary goal is to help users identify
funding opportunities that match their interests and background,
ultimately facilitating better access to relevant grants.

**MOTIVATION**

The process of identifying suitable grants can be time-consuming and
challenging, especially given the vast number of opportunities available
across different industries and sectors. By providing personalized
recommendations, this application aims to simplify and expedite the
search for appropriate funding opportunities. Utilizing user data,
including preferences and historical ratings, allows for a more targeted
approach to recommending grants. This can improve the chances of users
finding opportunities that align with their goals and needs. By offering
a tailored list of recommendations, the application can help users
connect with grant providers in industries that are relevant to them.
This may increase the chances of successful grant applications and
overall user satisfaction.

**PROJECT GOALS**

We seek to deliver an efficient and personalized grant recommendation
system, leveraging data and machine learning techniques to help users
identify and connect with funding opportunities that match their
interests and expertise. Through this application, the goal is to
simplify the grant-seeking process and improve access to relevant
opportunities for users. We utilize a user-based collaborative filtering
(UBCF) model to generate personalized grant recommendations based on
users historical interactions and preferences. The app presents the top
10 recommended grants to users based on their preferences and industry
choice. This ensures that users receive a concise and relevant list of
opportunities.

**SHINY APPLICATIONS**

The Shiny app \"Movie Recommendations with Shiny\" presented by RStudio
serves as a notable example of how recommender systems can be
effectively integrated into a Shiny application, providing a basis for
the design and structure of our project. Shiny applications demonstrate
the use of dynamic user interfaces and server logic, motivating the
creation of an application with similar capabilities.

**RECOMMENDATION PLATFORMS**

Platforms such as Amazon, Spotify offer personalized recommendations.
These platforms provided inspiration for the concept of matching users
with funding opportunities based on their preferences.

**CLASSROOM DISCUSSIONS AND COURSEWORK**

Concepts and techniques covered in advanced R programming courses, such
as data manipulation with dplyr and working with data frames, influenced
the approach to data preprocessing and analysis in the project.
Classroom discussions around the challenges and best practices in
designing recommendation systems also provided insights that shaped the
project\'s goals and implementation.

III. **INITIAL QUESTIONS**

**How can we provide personalized grant recommendations to users based
on their interests and preferences?**

The goal was to develop a recommendation system that would use
collaborative filtering to match users with grants that align with their
interests and industry preferences.

**What is the most effective approach for implementing a user-based
collaborative filtering (UBCF) model in a Shiny application?**

We wanted to explore how to use the recommenderlab package to implement
a UBCF model in a Shiny app and determine the best practices for making
accurate and relevant recommendations.

**How can we create a user-friendly and intuitive interface for
interacting with the recommendation system?**

We sought to design a Shiny app that would allow users to easily
authenticate themselves, input their preferences, and receive
recommendations without confusion or complexity.

**How can we ensure that the recommendations are relevant and valuable
to the users?**

Beyond just providing recommendations, we wanted to ensure that the top
recommended grants aligned with the users interests and preferences.

IV. **DATA**

The data consists of two main datasets, one containing information about
grant opportunities and another containing user ratings for grants.

**GRANT OPPORTUNITIES DATA**

**Features**:

-   **grant_id**: A unique identifier for each grant opportunity.

-   **grant_name**: The name of the grant opportunity.

-   **industry**: The industry or sector to which the grant opportunity
    belongs.

The data is imported from a CSV file using the read.csv() function.
Column names are adjusted to make them more descriptive and consistent.

**USER RATINGS DATA**

**Features**:

-   **user_id**: A unique identifier for each user.

-   **grant_name**: The name of the grant for which the rating is
    provided.

-   **rating**: The user\'s rating for the grant (e.g., -1 for dislike,
    0 for neutral, 1 for like).

A user DataFrame was created with a set number of users (**n_users =
100**). Random ratings are generated using the sample() function, with
probabilities assigned to different rating values. A ratings DataFrame
(**ratings_df**) is created by combining user IDs, grant names, and
ratings. The ratings DataFrame is converted to a realRatingMatrix for
use with the **recommenderlab** package.

**SPLITTING DATA FOR EVALUATION**

An evaluation scheme is set up using evaluationScheme() from
recommenderlab, which splits the data into training and test sets (70%
training, 30% test). The training data is used to build the
recommendation model, while the test data is used to evaluate its
performance. When generating recommendations, the user predictions are
joined with the grant opportunities data to filter recommendations based
on the user\'s preferred industry. Data is sorted by predicted ratings
to present the top recommendations.

Overall, data import and wrangling involved importing data from CSV
files, creating synthetic user ratings, converting data into appropriate
formats, and splitting data for model evaluation. Proper data
preparation was crucial for the successful implementation and evaluation
of the recommendation system.

V.  **EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS**

**VISUALIZATIONS AND STATISTICAL SUMMARIES**

We used a bar chart showing the distribution of grants across different
industries to help identify which industries have more or fewer
opportunities. Also, a plot of grant occurrences (grant names)
highlighted popular or less common grants in the data. We also used
basic statistics such as count, mean, and median for each industry and
observe any imbalances in grant availability across industries.

A bar chart or histogram showed us the frequency of different ratings
(-1, 0, 1) across all the users which gave us insight into the overall
user sentiment toward grants. Plotting the number of ratings per grant
revealed popular or less-rated grants. Observing the relationship
between user preferences and industries provided us insight into the
distribution of user interests across industries.

**DATA ANALYSIS CONCLUSIONS**

Observations of imbalances in industry distributions or rating
frequencies influenced in the model and analysis choices. Identifying
varying user engagement levels helped us in addressing potential issues
with sparse user data. The patterns in user-grant ratings guided us in
the choice of recommendation algorithms and methods.

Assessing correlations and similarities between user preferences and
grant characteristics guided us in the selection of appropriate
filtering methods (user-based vs. item-based collaborative filtering).

The exploratory data analysis provided the foundation for the
statistical analyses and modelling choices used in the project. It
guided the decision to use a user-based collaborative filtering
approach. Additionally, the Exploratory Data Analysis highlighted the
importance of industry-specific recommendations, shaping the design of
the application to prioritize user preferences and enhance the relevance
of recommendations.

VI. **DATA ANALYSIS**

We applied a user-based collaborative filtering (UBCF) model using the
recommenderlab package to generate grant recommendations based on user
preferences and historical ratings.

**USER BASED COLLABORATIVE FILTERING (UBCF)**

UBCF is a type of recommendation system that leverages similarities
between users to predict their preferences. In this approach, users who
have similar preferences are identified, and the preferences of similar
users are used to make predictions for a target user. We implemented the
UBCF model using the Recommender() function from recommenderlab with
parameters to normalize the data and optimize the model. The model was
trained on the training data (70% of the ratings data) and used to
predict ratings for the test data.

The UBCF method was chosen for its simplicity, effectiveness, and
flexibility in providing personalized recommendations based on user
preferences and historical ratings. While other methods such as
item-based collaborative filtering and matrix factorization were
considered, they were ultimately not used due to the ease of use and
interpretability of UBCF, as well as its ability to align with the
project\'s goals of providing personalized recommendations to users
based on their preferences.

VII. **SUMMARY**

**CONCLUSIONS**

The user ratings data showed a range of preferences towards different
grants, with most ratings being neutral (0) and a smaller proportion of
likes (1) and dislikes (-1). The grant opportunities data displayed
variation in the availability of grants across different industries,
with some industries having more opportunities than others.

By applying a user-based collaborative filtering (UBCF) model using the
**recommenderlab** package, we were able to generate personalized grant
recommendations based on user preferences and similarities with other
users.

-   **Approach**: UBCF model predicted user preferences for grants and
    filtered recommendations based on the user\'s preferred industry.

-   **Justification**: The model\'s effectiveness is justified by its
    ability to generate personalized recommendations based on user
    similarities and the approach\'s widespread use in recommendation
    systems.

The Shiny application allowed users to authenticate themselves and
specify their preferred industry to receive tailored recommendations.

-   **Approach**: By providing a simple interface for inputting user IDs
    and selecting preferred industries, users could easily navigate the
    app and view recommended grants.

-   **Justification**: This streamlined interface maximized user
    engagement and made the application accessible to users with
    different levels of experience.

The application presented the top 10 recommended grants based on the
user\'s preferences and predicted ratings.

-   **Approach**: The recommendations were ranked in descending order of
    predicted rating, ensuring users saw the most relevant and
    highest-rated grants first.

-   **Justification**: This ranking method aligned with the goal of
    providing users with the most promising grant opportunities.

**LIMITATIONS**

The presence of sparse user-grant interactions may limit the model\'s
accuracy for certain users or grants. This could lead to less reliable
recommendations for users with minimal historical data.

Users may have different rating scales (e.g., some may rate grants more
harshly or leniently), which can affect the model\'s predictions.
Normalization methods were used to mitigate this bias, but it could
still impact results.

Some industries may be overrepresented or underrepresented in the grant
opportunities data, affecting the range and quality of recommendations
available in certain industries.

Overall, the project successfully implemented a user-based collaborative
filtering model to generate personalized grant recommendations in a
Shiny application. While the model effectively provided tailored
recommendations based on user preferences, there were some limitations
due to sparse data and potential biases in user ratings.

Despite these limitations, the application provides a valuable tool for
helping users discover grant opportunities that align with their
interests and industry preferences. Future improvements could involve
incorporating more comprehensive data sources and exploring hybrid
recommendation models to enhance the quality of recommendations.
